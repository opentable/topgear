					<b> Fixed teams </b>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					- Teams co-located (Development, Design, Product)
					<br/>
					- Teams have quite a bit of historical context, on top of issues, capabilities, working closely together on a roadmap.
					<br/>
					- Prioritization is easy, though if there are lot of priorities, it is harder for a single team to fulfill all of those

					<b> Flexible / Resource teams </b>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					- Teams are completely ‘non-domain’ aligned.
					<br/>
					- Resources move around taking on high priority tasks that match the skillset.
